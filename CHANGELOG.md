## [3.0.0]

*WARNING*: for any code relying on previously undocumented behavior of
`state-flow.assertions.matcher-combinators/match?`, this release includes a
breaking change.

``` clojure
;; if you were doing this before in a binding
[actual (match? <expected> <step-that-produces-actual>)]
;; you can do this, now
[actual (fmap report->actual (match? <expected> <step-that-produces-actual>))]
;; or
[report (match? <expected> <step-that-produces-actual>)
 :let [actual (report->actual report)]]
```

- `state-flow.assertions.matcher-combinators/match?` returns a map instead of
   the `actual` value [#110](https://github.com/nubank/state-flow/pull/110)
  - use `state-flow.assertions.matcher-combinators/report->actual` to get the actual value if you need it
- Upgrade to [matcher-combinators 1.5.1](https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#151) (from 1.2.7))

  - Add `:on-error` option (with default to log and rethrow)
  - Add `:cleanup` option to clean up after an exception

  the error-state monad
