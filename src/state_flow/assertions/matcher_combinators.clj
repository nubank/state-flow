  - expected is any valid first argument to `matcher-combinators/match?`

(defmacro match?
  "Builds a state-flow step which uses matcher-combinators to make an
  assertion.

  `expected` can be a literal value or a matcher-combinators matcher
  `actual` can be a literal value, a primitive step, or a flow
  `params` are optional keyword-style args, supporting:

    :times-to-try optional, default 1
    :sleep-time   optional, millis to wait between tries, default 200

  Given (= times-to-try 1), match? will evaluate `actual` just once.

  Given (> times-to-try 1), match? will use `state-flow-probe/probe` to
  retry up to :times-to-try times, waiting :sleep-time between each try,
  and stopping when `actual` produces a value that matches `expected`.

  NOTE: when (> times-to-try 1), `actual` must be a step or a flow.

  Returns a map (in the left value) with information about the success
  or failure of the match, the details of which are used internally by
  state-flow and subject to change."
